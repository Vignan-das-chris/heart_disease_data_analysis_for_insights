Heart disease, also known as cardiovascular disease, refers to a group of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels. It is a significant public health concern and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of heart disease data plays a crucial role in understanding the factors associated with heart disease, identifying patterns, and gaining insights into the risk factors and potential preventive measures
Data visualization is a powerful tool for EDA. Plots such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and bar charts help visualize the distribution of variables, relationships between variables, and potential outliers.
Exploratory data analysis provides a foundation for more advanced analyses, such as predictive modeling and hypothesis testing. It helps researchers and healthcare professionals better understand the complex relationships between variables and develop targeted interventions and preventive strategies to reduce the burden of heart disease.
